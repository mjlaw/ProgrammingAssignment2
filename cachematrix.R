## Create the matrix object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Compute the inverse of the matrix returned by makeCacheMatrix. If the inverse has
## been calculated and the matrix has not changed, then cacheSolve retrieves the inverse 
## from cache. If the inverse has not been calculated, then compute the inverse through
## solve(x) and return its inverse

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
